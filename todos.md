# Project Development Log & Tasks

## Overview
This document tracks all development tasks and features implemented for the Worldpay ZIP Code Extractor application.

## Completed Features

### ✅ Initial Setup & Manual ZIP Code Extraction
- **Date**: Initial development
- **Description**: Created Next.js app with manual transaction ID input
- **Features**:
  - Manual copy/paste of transaction IDs
  - CSV file upload support
  - Worldpay API integration for ZIP code extraction
  - Progress tracking with batch processing
  - Results export to CSV
  - Error handling and retry logic

### ✅ Database Integration
- **Date**: Recent development
- **Description**: Integrated CrunchyBridge PostgreSQL database for transaction querying
- **Features**:
  - Read-only database connection to `payments` table
  - Environment-based configuration (staging/production)
  - Connection pooling and security settings
  - Database health check endpoint

**Technical Implementation**:
- Installed `pg` and `@types/pg` packages
- Created `lib/db.ts` with connection pooling
- Added database query interface with TypeScript types
- Configured SSL for CrunchyBridge connections

### ✅ Host User ID Filtering
- **Date**: Recent development
- **Description**: Added ability to filter transactions by event host/owner
- **Features**:
  - Database JOIN between `payments` and `events` tables
  - Host user ID as required filter parameter
  - Frontend validation and UI indicators

**Technical Implementation**:
- Updated database schema interfaces
- Modified SQL queries to include `LEFT JOIN events e ON p.event_id = e.id`
- Added `hostUserId` parameter to search interface
- Made host user ID required in both frontend and API validation

### ✅ Warehouse Cluster Migration (FDW Tables)
- **Date**: 2025-08-20
- **Description**: Migrated from database cluster to warehouse cluster with Foreign Data Wrapper (FDW) tables
- **Issue**: SQL queries failed with "permission denied for foreign table payments"
- **Solution**: Updated all table references to use FDW suffix
- **Changes**:
  - All table names now use `_fdw` suffix (e.g., `payments_fdw`, `events_fdw`, `users_fdw`)
  - Updated `lib/db.ts` searchPayments function
  - Updated `/api/nl-to-sql/route.ts` schema information and fallback queries
  - Updated `app/page.tsx` table options and SQL queries
  - Updated all JOIN queries to use FDW table names
  
**Technical Details**:
- Warehouse clusters use Foreign Data Wrapper (FDW) for read-only access
- FDW tables require explicit `_fdw` suffix in table names
- No schema changes required, only table name references
- Permissions are managed at the FDW level, not table level

**Additional Issue - FDW Column Mismatch**:
- **Problem**: FDW table definition includes `external_payrix` column that doesn't exist in remote table
- **Error**: "column 'external_payrix' does not exist" when using `SELECT *`
- **Solution**: Replace `SELECT *` with explicit column lists in SQL queries
- **Implementation**: Added automatic query modification in `/api/execute-sql` to replace `SELECT *` with specific columns for payments_fdw
- **Note**: The warehouse cluster's FDW definitions may be out of sync with the actual remote tables

**Auto-Correction Feature**:
- **Added**: Automatic table name correction in SQL queries
- **Behavior**: Queries using `payments`, `events`, or `users` are automatically corrected to use `_fdw` suffix
- **User Notification**: Toast message appears when queries are auto-corrected
- **Improved Error Handling**: Better JSON parsing error handling to prevent crashes on malformed responses

### ✅ Shadcn Calendar Date Pickers
- **Date**: Recent development
- **Description**: Replaced manual date inputs with visual calendar components
- **Features**:
  - Beautiful popover calendar interfaces
  - Date range selection (From/To)
  - Better UX with visual date picking
  - Proper date formatting and validation

**Technical Implementation**:
- Installed shadcn components: `calendar`, `popover`, `button`
- Created custom `DatePicker` component
- Integrated `date-fns` for date formatting
- Added calendar icons and styling

### ✅ Date Range Timezone Fix
- **Date**: Recent development
- **Description**: Fixed timezone issues with date range filtering
- **Problem**: Transactions created late in the day (e.g., 10:41 PM ET) were not appearing when filtering by that date due to UTC conversion
- **Solution**: 
  - Used PostgreSQL `::date` casting for timezone-aware date comparisons
  - Pass date strings directly to database instead of JavaScript Date objects
  - Ensure inclusive date filtering for entire days

**Technical Implementation**:
- Modified SQL queries to use `p.created_at::date >= $1::date`
- Updated interfaces to accept string dates instead of Date objects
- Tested edge cases with late-evening transactions

### ✅ ZIP Code Extraction Strategy
- **Date**: Recent development
- **Description**: Hybrid approach combining database queries with API calls
- **Strategy**:
  1. Query database for payment records by host user ID and date range
  2. Extract `transaction_id` from database results
  3. Use transaction IDs to call Worldpay API for ZIP code extraction
  4. Combine database metadata with API-retrieved ZIP codes

**Technical Implementation**:
- Modified API route to handle both database and API calls
- Added transaction ID format validation (`t1_txn_...`)
- Implemented proper error handling for both database and API failures
- Added rate limiting (100ms delay between API calls)

## Current Environment Setup

### Database Configuration
- **Staging**: CrunchyBridge PostgreSQL cluster `squadup-staging`
- **Tables**: `payments`, `events`, `users`
- **Connection**: Read-only access with SSL
- **Key Relationships**:
  - `payments.event_id` → `events.id`
  - `events.user_id` → Host User ID

### API Configuration
- **Staging**: `test-api.payrix.com` (needs to be updated to `api.payrix.com` for production)
- **Authentication**: API key-based authentication
- **Rate Limiting**: 100ms delay between requests
- **Format**: Only processes `t1_txn_...` format transaction IDs

## Known Issues & Notes

### ⚠️ Production Deployment Checklist
1. Update API endpoint from `test-api.payrix.com` to `api.payrix.com`
2. Switch to production database connection string

### ✅ Attendees List View
- **Date**: 2025-11-11
- **Description**: Converted app from search-based seat lookup to full attendees list view
- **Features**:
  - Displays all attendees for host user ID 9835080
  - Shows attendee name, seat ID, and validation timestamp in table format
  - Auto-loads data on page load
  - Refresh button to reload data
  - Clean, responsive table interface with proper column headers
  - Formats validated_at timestamps in readable format

**Technical Implementation**:
- Created new API route `/api/attendees-list` with GET endpoint
- Implemented SQL query joining events, event_attendees, users, and attendee_guests tables
- Extracts seat info from seat_obj.components or falls back to seat_id
- Gets check-in timestamp from attendee_guests.checkin_timestamp column
- Updated dashboard page to display data in table format instead of search cards
- Added date/time formatting for check-in timestamp field
- Removed search functionality in favor of full list view
- Uses useEffect to auto-load data on component mount

**Database Schema Discovery**:
- `event_attendees` table contains attendee names (first_name, last_name)
- `attendee_guests` table contains seat assignments (seat_id, seat_obj) and check-in data
- Check-in timestamp is stored in `attendee_guests.checkin_timestamp` (not validated_at)
- No separate tickets table - all data comes from the tables above

**Database Query** (Optimized):
```sql
SELECT
  COALESCE(ea.first_name || ' ' || ea.last_name, u.first_name || ' ' || u.last_name) as attendee_name,
  ag.seat_id,
  ag.seat_obj,
  ag.checkin_timestamp
FROM events e
INNER JOIN event_attendees ea ON ea.event_id = e.id
LEFT JOIN users u ON u.id = ea.user_id
LEFT JOIN attendee_guests ag ON ag.event_attendee_id = ea.id
WHERE e.user_id = 9835080
  AND ea.deleted_at IS NULL
  AND e.start_at >= NOW() - INTERVAL '365 days'
ORDER BY e.start_at DESC, ea.created_at DESC
LIMIT 10000
```

**Performance Optimizations**:
- Filters events to last 365 days only (reduces dataset significantly)
- Uses index_events_on_user_id for efficient filtering
- Added LIMIT 10000 to prevent excessive results
- Orders by event start_at DESC for most recent events first

### ✅ Attendees Seat Join Timeout Safeguard
- **Date**: 2025-11-21
- **Description**: Prevented `/api/attendees-list` from timing out when the `attendee_guests` join exceeds the database `statement_timeout`
- **Highlights**:
  - Added detection for PostgreSQL error code `57014` and fall back to an attendee-only query when necessary
  - Added per-event seat join retry to keep seat data whenever possible before degrading
  - Logged fallback execution time to keep observability of long-running seat lookups
  - Returned `seatAssignmentsIncluded` metadata so the UI (or logs) can detect whether seat data was included
  - Centralized attendee queries into reusable helpers for easier tuning
